# UTM Form Builder (Andrew's version)

## Install
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the api with the following command:

```bash
npm run production
```
That will start the server on port 7082. To run the development server with hot module reloading, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

That will start the webpack dev server on port 7081.
